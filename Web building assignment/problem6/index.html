    <h1>Chemistry Assigment</h1>
    <p>Chemistory is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elemenrs. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol. sucj as Fe for iron. H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified in to groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reaction are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i>Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas(<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>) and oxygen gas (<i>O<sub>2</sub></i>) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>).</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><b>Stiochiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reaction. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charges are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each elemnt in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the whole around us. From the composition of the air breathe to the reactions that power our bodies. chemistry influences every aspects of our lives.</p>
